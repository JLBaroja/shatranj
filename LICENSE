    This program may not be used in whole, nor in part, to enter
    any computer chess competition without written permission from
    the author.  Such permission will include the requirement that
    the program be entered under the name "Shatranj" so that   
    the program ancestry will be known.                                       
                                                                                
    Personal use does not allow anyone to enter this into a chess    
    tournament where other program authors are invited to participate.  You     
    can do your own local tournament, with Shatranj and other programs, since   
    this is for your personal enjoyment.  But you may not enter Shatranj into an  
    event where it will be in competition with other programs/programmers       
    without permission from the author.
