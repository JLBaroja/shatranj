# Shatranj

Shatranj is an bitboard-based, Open-Source, interactive chess programming module which allows manipulation of chess positions and experimentation with search algorithms and evaluation techniques. The project goal is to write a toolkit to aid in implementing Shannon Type B chess programs. As such, execution speed becomes less important then code clarity and expressive power of the implementation language. Having been written in an interpreted language, this module allows the chess programmer to manipulate bitboards in a natural, interactive manner much like signal processing toolkits allow communication engineers to manipulate vectors of sounds samples in MATLAB. The module currenly implements a simple recursive minimax search with alphabeta pruning, iterative deepening, uses short algebraic notation, handles repetition check, and the 50 move rule. Features lacking are quiescent checks, transition tables, negascout and MTD searching.
